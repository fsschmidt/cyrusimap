.SH NAME
imapd.conf \- IMAP configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR 
is the configuration file for the Cyrus IMAP server.  It defines
local parameters for IMAP. 
.PP
Each line of the \fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file has the form
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR
.PP
where \fIoption\fR is the name of the configuration option being set
and \fIvalue\fR is the value that the configuration option is being
set to.
.PP
Although there is no limit to the length of a line, a ``\\''
(backslash) character may be used as the last character on a line to
force it to continue on the next one.  No additional whitespace is
inserted before or after the ``\\''.  Note that a line that is split
using ``\\'' character(s) is still considered a single line.
For example
.IP
\fIoption\fR:\\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2 \\
.br
.in +1
\fIvalue\fR3
.PP
is equivalent to
.IP
\fIoption\fR: \fIvalue\fR1 \fIvalue\fR2   \fIvalue\fR3
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.
.PP
For boolean and enumerated options, the values ``yes'', ``on'', ``t'',
``true'' and ``1'' turn the option on, the values ``no'', ``off'',
``f'', ``false'' and ``0'' turn the option off.
.SH FIELD DESCRIPTIONS
.PP
The sections below detail options that can be placed in the
\fB/etc/imapd.conf\fR file, and show each option's default value.
Some options have no default value, these are listed with
``<no default>''.  Some options default to the empty string, these
are listed with ``<none>''.

.IP "\fBadmins:\fR <empty string>" 5
The list of userids with administrative rights.  Separate each userid
with a space.  Sites using Kerberos authentication may use
separate "admin" instances.
.PP
Note that accounts used by users should not be administrators.
Administrative accounts should not receive mail.  That is, if user
"jbRo" is a user reading mail, he should not also be in the admins line.
Some problems may occur otherwise, most notably the ability of
administrators to create top-level mailboxes visible to users,
but not writable by users. 
.IP "\fBafspts_localrealms:\fR <none>" 5
The list of realms which are to be treated as local, and thus stripped
during identifier canonicalization (for the AFSPTS ptloader module).
This is different from loginrealms in that it occurs later in the
authorization process (as the user id is canonified for PTS lookup) 
.IP "\fBafspts_mycell:\fR <none>" 5
Cell to use for AFS PTS lookups.  Defaults to the local cell. 
.IP "\fBallowallsubscribe:\fR 0" 5
Allow subscription to nonexistent mailboxes.  This option is
typically used on backend servers in a Murder so that users can
subscribe to mailboxes that don't reside on their "home" server.
This option can also be used as a workaround for IMAP clients which
don't play well with nonexistent or unselectable mailboxes (e.g.,
Microsoft Outlook). 
.IP "\fBallowanonymouslogin:\fR 0" 5
Permit logins by the user "anonymous" using any password.  Also
allows use of the SASL ANONYMOUS mechanism. 
.IP "\fBallowapop:\fR 1" 5
Allow use of the POP3 APOP authentication command.
.PP
Note that this command requires that SASL is compiled with APOP
support, that the plaintext passwords are available in a SASL auxprop
backend (e.g., sasldb), and that the system can provide enough entropy
(e.g., from /dev/urandom) to create a challenge in the banner. 
.IP "\fBallownewnews:\fR 0" 5
Allow use of the NNTP NEWNEWS command.
.PP
Note that this is a very expensive command and should only be
enabled when absolutely necessary. 
.IP "\fBallowplaintext:\fR 0" 5
Allow the use of cleartext passwords on the wire. 
.IP "\fBallowusermoves:\fR 0" 5
Allow moving user accounts (with associated meta-data) via RENAME
or XFER.
.PP
Note that measures should be taken to make sure that the user being
moved is not logged in, and cannot login during the move.  Failure
to do so may result in the user's meta-data (seen state,
subscriptions, etc) being corrupted or out of date. 
.IP "\fBaltnamespace:\fR 0" 5
Use the alternate IMAP namespace, where personal folders reside at the
same level in the hierarchy as INBOX.
.PP
This option ONLY applies where interaction takes place with the
client/user.  Currently this is limited to the IMAP protocol (imapd)
and Sieve scripts (lmtpd).  This option does NOT apply to admin tools
such as cyradm (admins ONLY), reconstruct, quota, etc., NOR does it
affect LMTP delivery of messages directly to mailboxes via
plus-addressing. 
.IP "\fBannotation_db:\fR skiplist" 5
The cyrusdb backend to use for mailbox annotations. 

Allowed values: \fIberkeley\fR, \fIberkeley-hash\fR, \fIskiplist\fR
.IP "\fBannotation_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
The absolute path to the annotations db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/annotations.db 
.IP "\fBanyoneuseracl:\fR 1" 5
Should non-admin users be allowed to set ACLs for the 'anyone'
user on their mailboxes?  In a large organization this can cause
support problems, but it's enabled by default. 
.IP "\fBannotation_definitions:\fR <none>" 5
File containing external (third-party) annotation definitions.
.PP
Each line of the file specifies the properties of an annotation and
has the following form:
.IP
\fIname\fR, \fIscope\fR, \fIattrib-type\fR, \fIproxy-type\fR,
\fIattrib-names\fR, \fIacl\fR
.IP \fIname\fR 5
is the hierarchical name as in the draft standard, typically of the
form /vendor/acme/blurdybloop
.IP \fIscope\fR 5
specifies whether the annotation is for the \fBserver\fR or a
\fBmailbox\fR
.IP \fIattrib-type\fR 5
specifies the attribute data type which is one of: \fBstring\fR,
\fBboolean\fR, \fBint\fR, \fBuint\fR, or \fBcontent-type\fR
.IP \fIproxy-type\fR 5
specifies whether this attribute is for the \fBbackend\fR or
\fBproxy\fR servers or both (\fBproxy_and_backend\fR) 
.IP \fIattrib-names\fR 5
is the space-separated list of available attributes for the
annotation. Possible attribute names are (where the suffixless \fBfoo\fR
permits both \fBfoo.priv\fR and \fBfoo.shared\fR): \fBalue\fR,
\fBvalue.shared\fR, \fBvalue.priv\fR, \fBsize\fR, \fBsize.shared\fR,
\fBsize.priv\fR, \fBmodifiedsince\fR, \fBmodifiedsince.shared\fR,
\fBmodifiedsince.priv\fR, \fBcontent-type\fR,
\fBcontent-type.shared\fR, \fBcontent-type.priv\fR
.IP \fIacl\fR 5
is the extra ACL requirements for setting annotations. This is the
standard IMAP ACL permission bit string format. Particularly useful
is the \fBa\fR right to require admin privileges. Note that some ACL
requirements (read and write on the mailbox) are hard-wired in the
server
.PP
Blank lines and lines beginning with ``#'' are ignored.

.IP "\fBauditlog:\fR 0" 5
Should cyrus output log entries for every action taken on a message
file or mailboxes list entry?  It's noisy so disabled by default, but
can be very useful for tracking down what happened if things look strange 
.IP "\fBauth_mech:\fR unix" 5
The authorization mechanism to use. 

Allowed values: \fIunix\fR, \fIpts\fR, \fIkrb\fR, \fIkrb5\fR
.IP "\fBautocreatequota:\fR 0" 5
If nonzero, normal users may create their own IMAP accounts by
creating the mailbox INBOX.  The user's quota is set to the value
if it is positive, otherwise the user has unlimited quota. 
.IP "\fBberkeley_cachesize:\fR 512" 5
Size (in kilobytes) of the shared memory buffer pool (cache) used
by the berkeley environment.  The minimum allowed value is 20.  The
maximum allowed value is 4194303 (4GB). 
.IP "\fBberkeley_locks_max:\fR 50000" 5
Maximum number of locks to be held or requested in the berkeley
environment. 
.IP "\fBberkeley_txns_max:\fR 100" 5
Maximum number of transactions to be supported in the berkeley
environment. 
.IP "\fBboundary_limit:\fR 1000" 5
messages are parsed recursively and a deep enough MIME structure
can cause a stack overflow.  Do not parse deeper than this many
layers of MIME structure.  The default of 1000 is much higher
than any sane message should have. 
.IP "\fBclient_timeout:\fR 10" 5
Number of seconds to wait before returning a timeout failure when
performing a client connection (e.g., in a murder environment) 
.IP "\fBcommandmintimer:\fR <none>" 5
Time in seconds. Any imap command that takes longer than this
time is logged. 
.IP "\fBconfigdirectory:\fR <none>" 5
The pathname of the IMAP configuration directory.  This field is
required. 
.IP "\fBdebug_command:\fR <none>" 5
Debug command to be used by processes started with -D option.  The string
is a C format string that gets 3 options: the first is the name of the
executable (without path).  The second is the pid (integer) and the third
is the service ID.  Example: /usr/local/bin/gdb /usr/cyrus/bin/%s %d 
.IP "\fBdefaultacl:\fR anyone lrs" 5
The Access Control List (ACL) placed on a newly-created (non-user)
mailbox that does not have a parent mailbox. 
.IP "\fBdefaultdomain:\fR <none>" 5
The default domain for virtual domain support 
.IP "\fBdefaultpartition:\fR <none>" 5
The partition name used by default for new mailboxes.  If not
specified, the partition with the most free space will be used for new
mailboxes. 
.IP "\fBdefaultserver:\fR <none>" 5
The backend server name used by default for new mailboxes.  If not
specified, the server with the most free space will be used for new
mailboxes. 
.IP "\fBdeletedprefix:\fR DELETED" 5
If "delete_mode" set to be "delayed", the prefix for the deleted
mailboxes hierarchy.  The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically
appended. 
.IP "\fBdelete_mode:\fR immediate" 5
The manner in which mailboxes are deleted. "immediate" mode is the
default behavior in which mailboxes are removed immediately.  In
"delayed" mode, mailboxes are renamed to a special hiearchy defined
by the "deletedprefix" option to be removed later by cyr_expire.


Allowed values: \fIimmediate\fR, \fIdelayed\fR
.IP "\fBdeleteright:\fR c" 5
Deprecated - only used for backwards compatibility with existing
installations.  Lists the old RFC 2086 right which was used to
grant the user the ability to delete a mailbox.  If a user has this
right, they will automatically be given the new 'x' right. 
.IP "\fBdisable_user_namespace:\fR 0" 5
Preclude list command on user namespace.  If set to 'yes', the 
LIST response will never include any other user's mailbox.  Admin
users will always see all mailboxes.  The default is 'no' 
.IP "\fBdisable_shared_namespace:\fR 0" 5
Preclude list command on user namespace.  If set to 'yes', the 
LIST response will never include any non-user mailboxes.  Admin
users will always see all mailboxes.  The default is 'no' 
.IP "\fBdisconnect_on_vanished_mailbox:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, IMAP/POP3/NNTP clients will be disconnected by the
server if the currently selected mailbox is (re)moved by another
session.  Otherwise, the missing mailbox is treated as empty while
in use by the client.
.IP "\fBduplicate_db:\fR skiplist" 5
The cyrusdb backend to use for the duplicate delivery suppression
and sieve. 

Allowed values: \fIberkeley\fR, \fIberkeley-nosync\fR, \fIberkeley-hash\fR, \fIberkeley-hash-nosync\fR, \fIskiplist\fR, \fIsql\fR
.IP "\fBduplicate_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
The absolute path to the duplicate db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/deliver.db 
.IP "\fBduplicatesuppression:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, lmtpd will suppress delivery of a message to a mailbox if
a message with the same message-id (or resent-message-id) is recorded
as having already been delivered to the mailbox.  Records the mailbox
and message-id/resent-message-id of all successful deliveries. 
.IP "\fBexpunge_mode:\fR default" 5
The mode in which messages (and their corresponding cache entries)
are expunged.  "default" mode is the default behavior in which the
message files are purged at the time of the EXPUNGE, but index
and cache records are retained to facilitate QRESYNC.  In "delayed"
mode, the message files are also retained, allowing unexpunge to
rescue them.  In "immediate" mode, both the message files and the
index records are removed as soon as possible.  In all cases,
nothing will be finally purged until all other processes have
closed the mailbox to ensure they never see data disappear under
them.  In "default" or "delayed" mode, a later run of "cyr_expire"
will clean out the retained records (and possibly message files).
This reduces the amount of I/O that takes place at the time of
EXPUNGE and should result in greater responsiveness for the client,
especially when expunging a large number of messages. 

Allowed values: \fIdefault\fR, \fIimmediate\fR, \fIdelayed\fR
.IP "\fBexpunge_days:\fR 7" 5
Number of days to retain expunged messages before cleaning up their
index records.  The default is 7.  This is necessary for QRESYNC
to work correctly.  If combined with delayed expunge (above) you
will also be able to unexpunge messages during this time. 
.IP "\fBfailedloginpause:\fR 3" 5
Number of seconds to pause after a failed login. 
.IP "\fBflushseenstate:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, changes to the seen state will be flushed to disk
immediately, otherwise changes will be cached and flushed when the
mailbox is closed.  This option may be used to fix the problem of
previously read messages being marked as unread in Microsoft
Outlook, at the expense of a loss of performance/scalability. 
.IP "\fBfoolstupidclients:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, only list the personal namespace when a LIST "*" is performed
(it changes the request to a LIST "INBOX*"). 
.IP "\fBforce_sasl_client_mech:\fR <none>" 5
Force preference of a given SASL mechanism for client side operations
(e.g., murder environments).  This is separate from (and overridden by)
the ability to use the <host shortname>_mechs option to set preferred
mechanisms for a specific host 
.IP "\fBfulldirhash:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, uses an improved directory hashing scheme which hashes
on the entire username instead of using just the first letter as
the hash.  This changes hash algorithm used for quota and user
directories and if \fIhashimapspool\fR is enabled, the entire mail
spool.
.PP
Note that this option CANNOT be changed on a live system.  The
server must be quiesced and then the directories moved with the
\fBrehash\fR utility. 
.IP "\fBhashimapspool:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, the partitions will also be hashed, in addition to the
hashing done on configuration directories.  This is recommended if
one partition has a very bushy mailbox tree. 
.IP "\fBhostname_mechs:\fR <none>" 5
Force a particular list of SASL mechanisms to be used when authenticating
to the backend server hostname (where hostname is the short hostname of
the server in question). If it is not specified it will query the server
for available mechanisms and pick one to use. - Cyrus Murder 
.IP "\fBhostname_password:\fR <none>" 5
The password to use for authentication to the backend server hostname
(where hostname is the short hostname of the server) - Cyrus Murder 
.IP "\fBidlesocket:\fR {configdirectory}/socket/idle" 5
Unix domain socket that idled listens on. 
.IP "\fBignorereference:\fR 0" 5
For backwards compatibility with Cyrus 1.5.10 and earlier -- ignore
the reference argument in LIST or LSUB commands. 
.IP "\fBimapidlepoll:\fR 60" 5
The interval (in seconds) for polling for mailbox changes and
ALERTs while running the IDLE command.  This option is used when
idled is not enabled or cannot be contacted.  The minimum value is
1.  A value of 0 will disable IDLE. 
.IP "\fBimapidresponse:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, the server responds to an ID command with a parameter 
list containing: version, vendor, support-url, os, os-version,
command, arguments, environment.  Otherwise the server returns NIL. 
.IP "\fBimapmagicplus:\fR 0" 5
Only list a restricted set of mailboxes via IMAP by using
userid+namespace syntax as the authentication/authorization id.
Using userid+ (with an empty namespace) will list only subscribed
mailboxes. 
.IP "\fBimplicit_owner_rights:\fR lkxa" 5
The implicit Access Control List (ACL) for the owner of a mailbox. 
.IP "\fB@include:\fR <none>" 5
Directive which includes the specified file as part of the
configuration.  If the path to the file is not absolute, CYRUS_PATH
is prepended. 
.IP "\fBimproved_mboxlist_sort:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, a special comparator will be used which will correctly
sort mailbox names that contain characters such as ' ' and '-'.
.PP
Note that this option SHOULD NOT be changed on a live system.  The
mailboxes database should be dumped (ctl_mboxlist) before the
option is changed, removed, and then undumped after changing the
option.  When not using flat files for the subscriptions databases
the same has to be done (cyr_dbtool) for each subscription database
See improved_mboxlist_sort.html.
.IP "\fBinternaldate_heuristic:\fR standard" 5
Mechanism to determine email internaldates on delivery/reconstruct.
"standard" uses time() when delivering a message, mtime on reconstruct.
"receivedheader" looks at the top most Received header
or time/mtime otherwise

.IP "\fBldap_filter:\fR (uid=%u)" 5
Specify a filter that searches user identifiers.  The following tokens can be
used in the filter string:

%%   = %

Specify a group method.  The "attribute" method retrieves groups from 
a multi-valued attribute specified in ldap_member_attribute.  

The "filter" method uses a filter, specified by ldap_member_filter, to find
groups; ldap_member_attribute is a single-value attribute group name. 

Allowed values: \fIattribute\fR, \fIfilter\fR

described in ciphers(1). 
.IP "\fBldap_tls_key:\fR <none>" 5
File containing the private client key. 
.IP "\fBldap_uri:\fR <none>" 5
Contains a list of the URLs of all the LDAP servers when using the
LDAP PTS module. 
.IP "\fBldap_version:\fR 3" 5
Specify the LDAP protocol version.  If ldap_start_tls and/or
ldap_use_sasl are enabled, ldap_version will be automatically
set to 3. 
.IP "\fBlmtp_downcase_rcpt:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, lmtpd will convert the recipient addresses to lowercase
(up to a '+' character, if present). 
.IP "\fBlmtp_fuzzy_mailbox_match:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, and the mailbox specified in the detail part of the
recipient (everything after the '+') does not exist, lmtpd will try
to find the closest match (ignoring case, ignoring whitespace,
falling back to parent) to the specified mailbox name. 
.IP "\fBlmtp_over_quota_perm_failure:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, lmtpd returns a permanent failure code when a user's
mailbox is over quota.  By default, the failure is temporary,
causing the MTA to queue the message and retry later. 
.IP "\fBlmtp_strict_quota:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, lmtpd returns a failure code when the incoming message
will cause the user's mailbox to exceed its quota.  By default, the
failure won't occur until the mailbox is already over quota. 
.IP "\fBlmtp_strict_rfc2821:\fR 1" 5
By default, lmtpd will be strict (per RFC 2821) with regards to which
envelope addresses are allowed.  If this option is set to false, 8bit
characters in the local-part of envelope addresses are changed to 'X'
instead.  This is useful to avoid generating backscatter with 
certain MTAs like Postfix or Exim which accept such messages. 
.IP "\fBlmtpsocket:\fR {configdirectory}/socket/lmtp" 5
Unix domain socket that lmtpd listens on, used by deliver(8). This should
match the path specified in cyrus.conf(5). 
.IP "\fBlmtptxn_timeout:\fR 300" 5
Timeout (in seconds) used during a lmtp transaction to a remote backend
(e.g. in a murder environment).  Can be used to prevent hung lmtpds
on proxy hosts when a backend server becomes unresponsive during a
lmtp transaction.  The default is 300 - change to zero for infinite. 
.IP "\fBloginrealms:\fR <empty string>" 5
The list of remote realms whose users may authenticate using cross-realm
authentication identifiers.  Separate each realm name by a space.  (A
cross-realm identity is considered any identity returned by SASL
with an "@" in it.). 
.IP "\fBloginuseacl:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, any authentication identity which has \fBa\fR rights on a
user's INBOX may log in as that user. 
.IP "\fBlogtimestamps:\fR 0" 5
Include notations in the protocol telemetry logs indicating the number of
seconds since the last command or response. 
.IP "\fBmailbox_default_options:\fR 0" 5
Default "options" field for the mailbox on create.  You'll want to know
what you're doing before setting this, but it can apply some default
annotations like duplicate supression 
.IP "\fBmailnotifier:\fR <none>" 5
Notifyd(8) method to use for "MAIL" notifications.  If not set, "MAIL"
notifications are disabled. 
.IP "\fBmaxheaderlines:\fR 1000" 5
Maximum number of lines of header that will be processed into cache
records.  Default 1000.  If set to zero, it is unlimited.
If a message hits the limit, an error will be logged and the rest of
the lines in the header will be skipped.  This is to avoid malformed
messages causing giant cache records 
.IP "\fBmaxmessagesize:\fR 0" 5
Maximum incoming LMTP message size.  If non-zero, lmtpd will reject
messages larger than \fImaxmessagesize\fR bytes.  If set to 0, this
will allow messages of any size (the default). 
.IP "\fBmaxquoted:\fR 131072" 5
Maximum size of a single quoted string for the parser.  Default 128k 
.IP "\fBmaxword:\fR 131072" 5

.IP "\fBmetapartition-name:\fR <none>" 5
The pathname of the metadata partition \fIname\fR, corresponding to
spool partition \fBpartition-name\fR.  For any mailbox residing in
a directory on \fBpartition-name\fR, the metadata files listed in
\fImetapartition_files\fR will be stored in a corresponding directory on
\fBmetapartition-name\fR.   Note that not every
\fBpartition-name\fR option is required to have a corresponding
\fBmetapartition-name\fR option, so that you can selectively choose
which spool partitions will have separate metadata partitions. 
.IP "\fBmupdate_authname:\fR <none>" 5
The SASL username (Authentication Name) to use when authenticating to the
mupdate server (if needed). 
.IP "\fBmupdate_config:\fR standard" 5
The configuration of the mupdate servers in the Cyrus Murder.
The "standard" config is one in which there are discreet frontend
(proxy) and backend servers.  The "unified" config is one in which
a server can be both a frontend and backend.  The "replicated"
config is one in which multiple backend servers all share the same
mailspool, but each have their own "replicated" copy of
mailboxes.db. 

Allowed values: \fIstandard\fR, \fIunified\fR, \fIreplicated\fR
.IP "\fBmunge8bit:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, lmtpd munges messages with 8-bit characters in the
headers.  The 8-bit characters are changed to `X'.  If
\fBreject8bit\fR is enabled, setting \fBmunge8bit\fR has no effect.
(A proper solution to non-ASCII characters in headers is offered by
RFC 2047 and its predecessors.) 
.IP "\fBmupdate_connections_max:\fR 128" 5
The max number of connections that a mupdate process will allow, this
is related to the number of file descriptors in the mupdate process.
Beyond this number connections will be immediately issued a BYE response.

The SASL password (if needed) to use when authenticating to the
mupdate server. 
.IP "\fBmupdate_port:\fR 3905" 5
The port of the mupdate server for the Cyrus Murder 
.IP "\fBmupdate_realm:\fR <none>" 5
The SASL realm (if needed) to use when authenticating to the mupdate
server. 
.IP "\fBmupdate_retry_delay:\fR 20" 5

.IP "\fBmupdate_workers_start:\fR 5" 5
The number of mupdate worker threads to start 
.IP "\fBnetscapeurl:\fR <none>" 5
If enabled at compile time, this specifies a URL to reply when
Netscape asks the server where the mail administration HTTP server
is.  Administrators should set this to a local resource. 
.IP "\fBnewsaddheaders:\fR to" 5
Space-separated list of headers to be added to incoming usenet
articles.  Added \fITo:\fR headers will contain email
delivery addresses corresponding to each newsgroup in the
\fINewsgroups:\fR header.  Added \fIReply-To:\fR headers will
contain email delivery addresses corresponding to each newsgroup in
the \fIFollowup-To:\fR or \fINewsgroups:\fR header.  If the
specified header(s) already exist in an article, the email
delivery addresses will be appended to the original header body(s).
.br
.sp
This option applies if and only if the \fBnewspostuser\fR option is
set. 

Allowed values: \fIto\fR, \fIreplyto\fR
.IP "\fBnewsgroups:\fR *" 5
A wildmat pattern specifying which mailbox hierarchies should be
treated as newsgroups.  Only mailboxes matching the wildmat will
accept and/or serve articles via NNTP.  If not set, a default
wildmat of "*" (ALL shared mailboxes) will be used.  If the
\fInewsprefix\fR option is also set, the default wildmat will be
translated to "<newsprefix>.*" 
.IP "\fBnewsmaster:\fR news" 5
Userid that is used for checking access controls when executing
Usenet control messages.  For instance, to allow articles to be
automatically deleted by cancel messages, give the "news" user
the 'd' right on the desired mailboxes.  To allow newsgroups to be 
automatically created, deleted and renamed by the corresponding
control messages, give the "news" user the 'c' right on the desired
mailbox hierarchies. 
.IP "\fBnewspeer:\fR <none>" 5
A list of whitespace-separated news server specifications to which
articles should be fed.  Each server specification is a string of
the form [user[:pass]@]host[:port][/wildmat] where 'host' is the fully
qualified hostname of the server, 'port' is the port on which the
server is listening, 'user' and 'pass' are the authentication
credentials and 'wildmat' is a pattern that specifies which groups
should be fed.  If no 'port' is specified, port 119 is used.  If
no 'wildmat' is specified, all groups are fed.  If 'user' is specified
(even if empty), then the NNTP POST command will be used to feed
the article to the server, otherwise the IHAVE command will be
used.
.br
.sp
A '@' may be used in place of '!' in the wildmat to prevent feeding
articles cross-posted to the given group, otherwise cross-posted
articles are fed if any part of the wildmat matches.  For example,
the string "peer.example.com:*,!control.*,@local.*" would feed all
groups except control messages and local groups to
peer.example.com.  In the case of cross-posting to local groups,
these articles would not be fed. 
.IP "\fBnewspostuser:\fR <none>" 5
Userid used to deliver usenet articles to newsgroup folders
(usually via lmtp2nntp).  For example, if set to "post", email sent
to "post+comp.mail.imap" would be delivered to the "comp.mail.imap"
folder.
.br
.sp
When set, the Cyrus NNTP server will add the header(s) specified in
the \fBnewsaddheaders\fR option to each incoming usenet article.
The added header(s) will contain email delivery addresses
corresponding to each relevent newsgroup.  If not set, no headers
are added to usenet articles. 
.IP "\fBnewsprefix:\fR <none>" 5
Prefix to be prepended to newsgroup names to make the corresponding
IMAP mailbox names. 
.IP "\fBnewsrc_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
The absolute path to the newsrc db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/fetchnews.db 
.IP "\fBnntptimeout:\fR 3" 5

in minutes.  The minimum value is 3, the default. 
.IP "\fBnotifysocket:\fR {configdirectory}/socket/notify" 5
Unix domain socket that the mail notification daemon listens on. 
.IP "\fBnotify_external:\fR <none>" 5
Path to the external program that notifyd(8) will call to send mail
notifications.
.PP
The external program will be called with the following
command line options:
.TP
.BI \-c " class"
.TP
.BI \-p " priority"
.TP
.BI \-u " user"
.TP
.BI \-m " mailbox"
.PP
And the notification message will be available on \fIstdin\fR.

.IP "\fBpartition-name:\fR <none>" 5
The pathname of the partition \fIname\fR.  At least one partition
pathname MUST be specified.  If the \fBdefaultpartition\fR option is
used, then its pathname MUST be specified.  For example, if the
value of the \fBdefaultpartion\fR option is \fBdefault\fR, then the
\fBpartition-default\fR field is required. 
.IP "\fBplaintextloginpause:\fR 0" 5
Number of seconds to pause after a successful plaintext login.  For
systems that support strong authentication, this permits users to  
perceive a cost of using plaintext passwords.  (This does not
affect the use of PLAIN in SASL authentications.) 
.IP "\fBplaintextloginalert:\fR <none>" 5
Message to send to client after a successful plaintext login. 
.IP "\fBpopexpiretime:\fR -1" 5
The number of days advertised as being the minimum a message may be
left on the POP server before it is deleted (via the CAPA command,
defined in the POP3 Extension Mechanism, which some clients may
support).  "NEVER", the default, may be specified with a negative
number.  The Cyrus POP3 server never deletes mail, no matter what  
the value of this parameter is.  However, if a site implements a 
less liberal policy, it needs to change this parameter
accordingly. 
.IP "\fBpopminpoll:\fR 0" 5
Set the minimum amount of time the server forces users to wait
between successive POP logins, in minutes. 
.IP "\fBpopsubfolders:\fR 0" 5
Allow access to subfolders of INBOX via POP3 by using
userid+subfolder syntax as the authentication/authorization id. 
.IP "\fBpoppollpadding:\fR 1" 5
Create a softer minimum poll restriction.  Allows \fIpoppollpadding\fR
connections before the minpoll restriction is triggered.  Additionally,
one padding entry is recovered every \fIpopminpoll\fR minutes.
This allows for the occasional polling rate faster than popminpoll, 
(i.e., for clients that require a send/receive to send mail) but still 
enforces the rate long-term.  Default is 1 (disabled).
.br
.sp
The easiest way to think of it is a queue of past connections, with one
slot being filled for every connection, and one slot being cleared 
every \fIpopminpoll\fR minutes. When the queue is full, the user
will not be able to check mail again until a slot is cleared.  If the 
user waits a sufficient amount of time, they will get back many or all
of the slots. 
.IP "\fBpoptimeout:\fR 10" 5
Set the length of the POP server's inactivity autologout timer,    
in minutes.  The minimum value is 10, the default. 
.IP "\fBpopuseacl:\fR 0" 5
Enforce IMAP ACLs in the pop server.  Due to the nature of the POP3
protocol, the only rights which are used by the pop server are 'r',
't', and 's' for the owner of the mailbox.  The 'r' right allows the
user to open the mailbox and list/retrieve messages.  The 't' right
allows the user to delete messages.  The 's' right allows messages
retrieved by the user to have the \\Seen flag set (only if
\fIpopuseimapflags\fR is also enabled). 
.IP "\fBpopuseimapflags:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, the pop server will set and obey IMAP flags.  Messages
having the \\Deleted flag are ignored as if they do not exist.
Messages that are retrieved by the client will have the \\Seen flag
set.  All messages will have the \\Recent flag unset. 
.IP "\fBpostmaster:\fR postmaster" 5
Username that is used as the 'From' address in rejection MDNs produced
by sieve. 
.IP "\fBpostuser:\fR <empty string>" 5
Userid used to deliver messages to shared folders.  For example, if
set to "bb", email sent to "bb+shared.blah" would be delivered to
the "shared.blah" folder.  By default, an email address of
"+shared.blah" would be used. 
.IP "\fBproc_path:\fR <none>" 5
Path to proc directory.  Default is NULL - must be an absolute path
if specified.  If not specified, the path $confdir/proc/ will be 
used. 
.IP "\fBproxy_authname:\fR proxy" 5
The authentication name to use when authenticating to a backend server
in the Cyrus Murder. 
.IP "\fBproxy_compress:\fR 0" 5
Try to enable protocol-specific compression when performing a client
connection to a backend server in the Cyrus Murder.
.PP
Note that this should only be necessary over slow network
connections.  Also note that currently only IMAP and MUPDATE support
compression. 
.IP "\fBproxy_password:\fR <none>" 5
The default password to use when authenticating to a backend server
in the Cyrus Murder.  May be overridden on a host-specific basis using
the hostname_password option. 
.IP "\fBproxy_realm:\fR <none>" 5
The authentication realm to use when authenticating to a backend server
in the Cyrus Murder 
.IP "\fBproxyd_allow_status_referral:\fR 0" 5
Set to true to allow proxyd to issue referrals to clients that support it
when answering the STATUS command.  This is disabled by default since
some clients issue many STATUS commands in a row, and do not cache the
connections that these referrals would cause, thus resulting in a higher
authentication load on the respective backend server. 
.IP "\fBproxyd_disable_mailbox_referrals:\fR 0" 5
Set to true to disable the use of mailbox-referrals on the
proxy servers. 
.IP "\fBproxyservers:\fR <none>" 5
A list of users and groups that are allowed to proxy for other
users, separated by spaces.  Any user listed in this will be
allowed to login for any other user: use with caution.
In a standard murder this option should ONLY be set on backends.
DO NOT SET on frontends or things won't work properly. 
.IP "\fBpts_module:\fR afskrb" 5

do the final 524 conversion to get a n AFS style name (using '.' instead
of '/', and using short names 
.IP "\fBptskrb5_strip_default_realm:\fR 1" 5
When using the AFSKRB ptloader module with Kerberos 5 canonicalization,
strip the default realm from the userid (this does not affect the stripping
of realms specified by the afspts_localrealms option) 
.IP "\fBqosmarking:\fR cs0" 5
This specifies the Class Selector or Differentiated Services Code Point
designation on IP headers (in the ToS field). 

Allowed values: \fIcs0\fR, \fIcs1\fR, \fIcs2\fR, \fIcs3\fR, \fIcs4\fR, \fIcs5\fR, \fIcs6\fR, \fIcs7\fR, \fIaf11\fR, \fIaf12\fR, \fIaf13\fR, \fIaf21\fR, \fIaf22\fR, \fIaf23\fR, \fIaf31\fR, \fIaf32\fR, \fIaf33\fR, \fIaf41\fR, \fIaf42\fR, \fIaf43\fR, \fIef\fR

warning (if this value is 0, or if the quota is smaller than this
amount, than warnings are always given). 
.IP "\fBreject8bit:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, lmtpd rejects messages with 8-bit characters in the
headers. 
.IP "\fBrfc2046_strict:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, imapd will be strict (per RFC 2046) when matching MIME
boundary strings.  This means that boundaries containing other
boundaries as substrings will be treated as identical.  Since
enabling this option will break some messages created by Eudora 5.1
(and earlier), it is recommended that it be left disabled unless
there is good reason to do otherwise. 
.IP "\fBrfc3028_strict:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, Sieve will be strict (per RFC 3028) with regards to
which headers are allowed to be used in address and envelope tests.
This means that only those headers which are defined to contain addresses
will be allowed in address tests and only "to" and "from" will be
allowed in envelope tests.  When disabled, ANY grammatically correct header
will be allowed. 
.IP "\fBsasl_auto_transition:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, the SASL library will automatically create authentication
secrets when given a plaintext password.  See the SASL documentation. 
.IP "\fBsasl_maximum_layer:\fR 256" 5
Maximum SSF (security strength factor) that the server will allow a
client to negotiate. 
.IP "\fBsasl_minimum_layer:\fR 0" 5

If using the alternate IMAP namespace, the prefix for the shared
namespace.  The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically appended. 
.IP "\fBsieve_allowreferrals:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, timsieved will issue referrals to clients when the
user's scripts reside on a remote server (in a Murder).
Otherwise, timsieved will proxy traffic to the remote server. 
.IP "\fBsieve_extensions:\fR fileinto reject vacation imapflags notify envelope relational regex subaddress copy" 5
Space-separated list of Sieve extensions allowed to be used in
sieve scripts, enforced at submission by timsieved(8).  Any
previously installed script will be unaffected by this option and
will continue to execute regardless of the extensions used.  This
option has no effect on options that are disabled at compile time
(e.g., "regex"). 

Allowed values: \fIfileinto\fR, \fIreject\fR, \fIvacation\fR, \fIimapflags\fR, \fInotify\fR, \fIinclude\fR, \fIenvelope\fR, \fIbody\fR, \fIrelational\fR, \fIregex\fR, \fIsubaddress\fR, \fIcopy\fR

submission by timsieved(8). 
.IP "\fBsieve_utf8fileinto:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, the sieve engine expects folder names for the
\fIfileinto\fR action in scripts to use UTF8 encoding.  Otherwise,
modified UTF7 encoding should be used. 
.IP "\fBsieve_sasl_send_unsolicited_capability:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, timsieved will emit a capability response after a successful
SASL authentication, per draft-martin-managesieve-12.txt .

If enabled, lmtpd will look for Sieve scripts in user's home
directories: ~user/.sieve. 
.IP "\fBsingleinstancestore:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, imapd, lmtpd and nntpd attempt to only write one copy
of a message per partition and create hard links, resulting in a
potentially large disk savings. 
.IP "\fBskiplist_always_checkpoint:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, this option forces the skiplist cyrusdb backend to
always checkpoint when doing a recovery.  This causes slightly
more IO, but on the other hand leads to more efficient databases,
and the entire file is already "hot". 
.IP "\fBskiplist_unsafe:\fR 0" 5
If enabled, this option forces the skiplist cyrusdb backend to
not sync writes to the disk.  Enabling this option is NOT RECOMMENDED. 
.IP "\fBsoft_noauth:\fR 1" 5
If enabled, lmtpd returns temporary failures if the client does not
successfully authenticate.  Otherwise lmtpd returns permanent failures
(causing the mail to bounce immediately). 
.IP "\fBspecialusealways:\fR 0" 5

The cyrusdb backend to use for the TLS cache. 

Allowed values: \fIberkeley\fR, \fIberkeley-nosync\fR, \fIberkeley-hash\fR, \fIberkeley-hash-nosync\fR, \fIskiplist\fR, \fIsql\fR
.IP "\fBtlscache_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
The absolute path to the tlscache db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/tls_sessions.db 
.IP "\fBtls_cert_file:\fR <none>" 5
File containing the certificate presented for server authentication
during STARTTLS.  A value of "disabled" will disable SSL/TLS.

.IP "\fBuserdeny_db:\fR flat" 5
The cyrusdb backend to use for the user access list. 

Allowed values: \fIflat\fR, \fIberkeley\fR, \fIberkeley-hash\fR, \fIskiplist\fR, \fIsql\fR
.IP "\fBuserdeny_db_path:\fR <none>" 5
The absolute path to the userdeny db file.  If not specified,
will be confdir/user_deny.db 
.IP "\fBuser_folder_limit:\fR 0" 5
Limit the number of folders a user can create in their INBOX.  
Set to 0 (default) for no limit.  Only affects folders in user. 
.IP "\fBusername_tolower:\fR 1" 5
Convert usernames to all lowercase before login/authentication.  This
is useful with authentication backends which ignore case during
username lookups (such as LDAP).  
.IP "\fBuserprefix:\fR Other Users" 5
If using the alternate IMAP namespace, the prefix for the other users
namespace.  The hierarchy delimiter will be automatically appended. 
.IP "\fBunix_group_enable:\fR 1" 5
Should we look up groups when using auth_unix (disable this if you are
not using groups in ACLs for your IMAP server, and you are using auth_unix
with a backend (such as LDAP) that can make getgrent() calls very
slow) 
.IP "\fBunixhierarchysep:\fR 0" 5
Use the UNIX separator character '/' for delimiting levels of
mailbox hierarchy.  The default is to use the netnews separator
character '.'. 
.IP "\fBvirtdomains:\fR off" 5
Enable virtual domain support.  If enabled, the user's domain will
be determined by splitting a fully qualified userid at the last '@'
or '%' symbol.  If the userid is unqualified, and the virtdomains
option is set to "on", then the domain will be determined by doing
a reverse lookup on the IP address of the incoming network
interface, otherwise the user is assumed to be in the default
domain (if set). 

Allowed values: \fIoff\fR, \fIuserid\fR, \fIon\fR
.IP "\fBxlist-*:\fR <none>" 5
Cyrus 2.4 ONLY - enable special use flags.  The valid names
can be taken from GMail's XLIST documents or RFC 6154.
Attribute name in the configuration key should be defined in
lowercase. The attribute value is case sensitive, may contain
whitespace and must be valid UTF7-IMAP string.  It must
exactly match the name of the subfolder of a user's INBOX.

Example: xlist-drafts: My Drafts

Every user on your server with a 'INBOX.My Drafts' folder will get 
the special use flag "\Drafts" added.  Later versions of Cyrus
have a much more flexible RFC 6154 compatible system.
